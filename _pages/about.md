I'm a third year undergraudate student from School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China. My research interest includes early universe, cosmological phase transition, gravitational waves, dark matter and so on.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Pro. Yifu Cai](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yifucai/) of [Cospa Lab](https://cospa.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) from  Department of Astronomy, School of Physical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China.

You can find my CV here: [Jiahang Zhong's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf)

I have some ongoing project:

GWs from PT catalyzed by PBH

Dynamical systme of Lovelock Cosmology

I have done some course project before:

[Cosmological Phase Transition and Gravitational Waves](../assets/.pdf) in the course Compuational Physics, which is a report and replicate of Article [Two-Field Cosmological Phase Transitions and Gravitational Waves in the Singlet Majoron](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05835)

[Debye phonon](../assets/debye.pdf) in the course Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics A, which is an introduction of finite temperature field theory and its application on Debye phonon.

[Quantization of Vector Field](../assets/vectorfield.pdf) in the course Quantum Field Theory, which is a report of general quantization method of vector field.

[Atom origin](../assets/Atomorigin.pdf) in the course Atom Physics A, which is an introduction to early universe, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and recombination, aiming to explain what is the origin of atoms.

[Collective Sideband Transition Based on Optical Adiabatic Control](../assets/Collective.pdf) in the course Optics A, which is an introduction to Coherent population transfer among quantum states of atoms and molecules.
